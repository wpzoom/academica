== ABOUT ACADEMICA ==

Academica is an education- and school-oriented CMS theme with a three-column layout and modern design. It is easy to customize and comes with a custom widget, three templates for Posts and Pages.

Please note:
The Footer Menu is best suitable for short menues with just a few links, as it only supports one menu level.

More customization options & features are available in the PRO version. https://www.wpzoom.com/themes/academica-pro-3/
